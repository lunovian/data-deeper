Feynman AI, inspired by the legendary physicist Richard Feynman, is at the cutting edge of scientific discovery. By leveraging artificial intelligence to uncover symbolic relationships in data, Feynman AI empowers researchers to automate complex reasoning processes and accelerate breakthroughs across disciplines.

## What is Feynman AI?

Feynman AI is an advanced platform for symbolic regression, a powerful AI technique that identifies mathematical expressions to describe relationships within data. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which often function as black boxes, symbolic regression provides interpretable solutions, making it particularly valuable for scientific applications.

### Key Features of Feynman AI:

1. **Symbolic Regression**: Uncover clear, interpretable mathematical formulas from raw data.
2. **Automated Reasoning**: Analyze relationships within datasets without manual intervention.
3. **Cross-Disciplinary Applications**: Solve problems in physics, biology, engineering, and more.

## Why Feynman AI is a Game-Changer

Scientific research often involves working with vast amounts of data to uncover underlying principles. Feynman AI bridges the gap between raw data and human understanding by automating hypothesis generation and validation.

### 1. **Interpretable AI for Science**

Unlike neural networks, which excel at pattern recognition but lack interpretability, Feynman AI focuses on producing formulas that humans can understand and apply. For example:

**Input Data:** A dataset of distances, times, and velocities.  
**Feynman AI Output:** The formula <InlineMath math="v = \frac{d}{t}" /> (velocity = distance/time).

This interpretability ensures that researchers can trust and validate the AI's findings.

### 2. **Efficiency in Research**

Manually deriving mathematical models from experimental data is time-consuming. Feynman AI automates this process, significantly reducing the time required for experimentation and analysis.

**Example in Action:**

```python
# Example code snippet for symbolic regression using a sample library
from feynman_ai import SymbolicRegressor

# Load your data
data = {
    "distance": [10, 20, 30],
    "time": [2, 4, 6],
    "velocity": [5, 5, 5],
}

# Initialize the regressor
model = SymbolicRegressor()

# Fit the model
formula = model.fit(data)
print(f"The derived formula is: {formula}")
```

Output:

```
The derived formula is: velocity = distance / time
```
